//"Your personal settings for GitHub Copilot include an option to either allow or block code completion suggestions that match publicly available code. 
// If you choose to block suggestions matching public code, GitHub Copilot checks code completion suggestions with their surrounding code of about 150 characters 
// against public code on GitHub. If there is a match, or a near match, the suggestion is not shown to you."
//
//My public settings for GitHub Copilot are set to block suggestions matching public code. That has been my setting since I started using GitHub Copilot.
//That will continue to be my setting for GitHub Copilot at least while I finish grad school and any future academics.
//I have GitHub Copilot enabled in Visual Studio 2022. I have been using GitHub Copilot since Fall 2023. 
//GitHub Copilot helps me with comments, and writing redundant code or similar code to what I have written before.
//I use the occasional suggestion from Github Copilot in the very rare times that it makes sense with that I am writing.
//I quite often edit the suggestions from GitHub Copilot that I do not outright ignore.
//For me, GitHub Copilot is like using the "home" key on my keyboard. It is a tool to reduce the grind a bit and give my irritable wrists a break. It is not a brain break"
//
//I forgot to include this infomation in my ps1 p5 reference list. I thought that it was one of the carry over references 
//for default cmake project, but just learned today that it wasn't. I apologize for that.
//
// I am using Github Copilot as a basic study aid. I am not using it to write my code for me. I am using Github Copilot within the guidelines.
// of the academic integrity policy San Diego State University. Hence, grading for ps1 p5, ps2 p2, and any future problems is clearly
// an evaluation of my understanding of the material and my ability to write code.
